# pmtables 0.9.0

- `pt_demographics()` was refactored (#363).
  - Include the median in the default output
  - Rows where `Statistic` is "Missing" (provided by the default summary function for 
    continuous data) and all summary column are "0" are dropped by default
  - New argument `drop_miss` can be used to optionally retain the "Missing" stat for 
    all continuous data summaries

- `pt_inventory_long()` is a new function to create data inventory summaries like
  those generated by `pt_data_inventory()`, but stratified by multiple covariates 
  (#360).

- When a caption macro name is provided to `stable_long()`, it will only be used if 
  the macro is defined; if the macro is not defined, some replacement text is 
  included noting that the macro will be used once it is defined (#355).


# pmtables 0.8.1

## Bugs Fixed

- Fixed a bug in preview helpers (`st_as_image()` and `st2report()`) where 
  a list was getting passed as `.envir` to `glue::glue()` rather than an 
  environment; this was causing `glue::glue()` to fail after changes rolled out 
  in glue version 1.8.0 (#346).

# pmtables 0.8.0

- New functionality to include output file path information in the table 
  annotation (#341).

# pmtables 0.7.0

- New functionality to create table notes from glossary files (#326). 
  - `read_glossary()` reads from `.tex` or `.yaml` formatted files, returning a
    glossary object
  - `select_glossary()` selects specific entries from a glossary object
  - `as_glossary()` creates a glossary object on the fly or from a list
  - `glossary_notes()` creates notes from a glossary object, a list, or the 
    name of a glossary file
  - `st_notes_glo()` creates and and attaches notes to a table in a pipeline
- `stable_save_image()` added to create an image from a table and save to a 
  specific location; this builds on `st_aspdf()` and `st_aspng()`, adding 
  convenient syntax and options (#333). 
- The `maxex` argument to `sig()` can now be set through the `pmtables.maxex` 
  option (#328). 

## Bugs Fixed

- Fixed a bug in `pt_cat_long()` when the `by` argument is used with no all 
  data summary (#330).

# pmtables 0.6.0

- `st_caption()` function added to associate a caption (including short 
  caption and possibly a label) to any table; captions will appear in 
  `st2report()` outputs; captions will always be written to file for 
  `stable_long` outputs and can be optionally written to file for `stable` 
  outputs (#313).

- `yaml_as_df()` will now retain row names in a column named by the new argument
  `row_var` (#317).

- `st_align()`, `st_left()`, `st_right()` and `st_center()` can now be called
  multiple times in a pipeline, supported by new update method for `aligncol`
  objects (#315). 

- `st_clone()` function added to make a copy of `stobject` objects (#314).

- The `id_col` argument to `pt_cont_long()` and `pt_cont_wide()` is 
  deprecated (#305).
  
## Bugs Fixed

  objects (#312).

  `pt_data_inventory()` (#297).

## Bugs Fixed

- Fixed bug where `all_name` was not getting used in `pt_data_inventory()` 
  (#297).

- Fixed bug where detached table notes were getting rendered too close to the 
  main table when building standalone pdf under certain TeX distributions
  (#286).

# pmtables 0.5.0

- New functions `st_as_image()`, `st2pdf()`, and `st2png()` to render tables with 
  TeX to either `pdf` or `png` format; image files may be kept on disk
  or read back for display while knitting; `pdflatex` system dependency for 
  `pdf` images and `latex` + `dvipng` for `png` images; additional Suggested
  packages include `magick` and `pdftools` (#277, #278). 
  
- `sig()` now returns character when integer type is passed (#272). 

- `st_new()` is now generic with dispatch for `data.frame` and objects with 
  class `pmtable`; most pipeline functions can now be used to customize
  tables coming from `pt_cat_*`, `pt_cont_*`, `pt_demographics()` and 
  `pt_data_inventory()` (#274).
  
- New functions `st_notes_detach()`, `st_notes_rm()`, `st_notes_app()`,

  with table notes in a pipe context (#274).
  
- `st_span()` and `st_span_split()` accept `align` argument to push column 
  spanner titles to the left, right or center (default); the argument eventually
  gets passed to `colgroup()` (#261).

- `pt_cat_wide()`, `pt_cat_long()` and `pt_demographics()` gain argument 
  `denom` to alter the denominator when calculating percents for categorical
  data summaries (#268).

- `pt_cat_wide()` gains argument `complete` to display missing levels of 
  `by` and `panel` (#268).

- Put stories in yaml format; add script to build validation docs from the
  yaml file (#269, #270).

  the spanner title on left or right in addition to the center (default)
  #260, #261.

  table contents to the right relative to the panel header row so that
  contents under the panel header are indented #251, #253. 

- Panel header rows are now modified so that the header row stays
  with the first non-header row for longtable output #252, #253.

  notes for `pt_data_inventory()` #254, #255.

  with some data that underlies the table; the environment can be accessed with 
  `get_debug_data()`
- Added complete series of `st_*` functions that can be used in a pipeline to set arguments 
  for `stable()`; see `inst/demo-pipe.pdf`

- The prefixes for `r_file` and `output_file` are only settable with options `r.file.label`

- Fix warning message when trying to align a column not in the data set
- Fix warning message when trying to add unit to column not in the data set
- Add several new package options; see `?pt_opts`
- Add `center` argument to `col_fixed`; when `ragged` is `no`, the column can still be 
fixed and centered

whole vector itself

number; enter a negative number if you want to remove space between header rows;
this should only be required when row space is increased
